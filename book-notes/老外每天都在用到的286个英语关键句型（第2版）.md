## 老外每天都在用到的286个英语关键句型（第2版）
> 朱子熹

### 前言

怎样才能最有效地学习英语？”可能每个人对这个问题都有着不同的见解。有的人可能会说“背好英语单词”，也有人可能会说“用英语来写日记”或是“多看外国的电影，潜移默化地学英语”。当然，类似的方法还有许多，但是一直都没有一种让广大英语学习者接受的持久的学习方法。

句型的学习指的是学习英美人在与人沟通时常会使用到的句型。掌握这些常用句型后，只要把句型当做框架，在其中插入各种英语单词或短语，就能创造出不计其数的句子。想要在最短的时间内突破无法开口说英语的瓶颈，最有效的方法就是学习句型。

### Unit 1 There be句型

句型“There be……”是表示某事物存在与否的句型，句中的“there”只起到引导的作用，句子的真正主语是谓语动词“be”后面的单数可数名词或者复数可数名词。“be”的情况视主语而定，且与最邻近的主语保持一致。

◆There is a watermelon and some oranges on the table.桌子上有一个西瓜和一些橘子。

句型“There be……”是表示某事物存在与否的句型，还可以用各种情态动词以及含有情态意义的动词或动词短语。“There must be……”翻译为“一定有……”。

◆Please wait, there must be something wrong.请等一等，一定有什么搞错了。

——There used to be no school in the mountains.——The learning environment is still poor here today.——山区里曾经没有学校。——现在这里的学习环境仍然很差。

表达预见等意思。有如下句型：There may be……可能有……There used to be……曾经有……There seems to be……似乎有……There happen to be……碰巧有……等。

句型“There is no use/sense（in）doing something”中，介词in一般可省略，翻译为“做……没有用/没有意义”。征服句型◆There is no use in crying.哭是没有用的。◆There is no use in sending me present.送我礼物也没有用。

根据句型中名词的不同，还有以下几种句型：There is no good in……做……毫无好处；There is no harm in……做……没有坏处。例如：There is no harm in trying it.不妨试一试。

句型“There seems/appears to be+主语”中的“seem”和“appear”作系动词，很多时候句型中的“to be”可以省略，翻译为“看起来、似乎……”。

——似乎没有别的选择了

句型“There is no need……”中，“need”后面可以跟动名词或动词不定式。“need”后面可以加“for”表示对某人来说。句中的“there”不能用“it”来代替。本句型翻译为“没有必要/不能……”。

◆There is no need for you to wait for me till midnight.你没有必要一直等我到午夜。

——Could I ask you about this accident?——There were two passengers injured and the driver dead.——我能问你有关事故的情况吗？——有两名乘客受伤，司机死了。

——There is not much to look.

本句型的标准形式是“There be+名词/名词词组+不定式/现在分词/过去分词”，例如：There is nothing to be worried about.没有什么好担心的。

There being”也可看作是There be的非谓语形式，在句中作状语、主语等。“There being”还可以作介词宾语，相当于带逻辑主语的动名词形式。

没有什么可以打动我，我离开了。
